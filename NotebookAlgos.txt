Following are the important things needed to be included in the team notebook
Let us make notebook soon and practice the implementations given


Data structures

Segment tree with lazy propagation
Persistent segtree
Small to large merge (just backinserter line, in case we forget)
Policy based DS
Trie
Suffix Array
Heavy-light decomposition
Centroid
Fenwick tree (incase Segment tree TLEs)
Treap
Dynamic Connectivity



Maths

Finding solution of diophantine eqns 
Mobius inversion - small amount of theory and common inversion pairs
linear sieve
Newton's method for roots
Miller rabin primality test
Pollard rho factorization
Integration by simpson's formula
struct for matrices and polynomials
burnside's lemma
catalan numbers and stirling number common occurences
Gray codes
Gaussian elimination code



Strings

KMP
Z-algorithm
some hashtable code with prewritten large modulos to check collision
Aho-Coharasick
Manacher algo
Lyndon factorization (maybe not really needed, read once - simple algo)

check if two line segments intersect
Circle-line intersection
Circle-circle intersection
counterclockwise (ccw function)
angle bw two lines or line segments
common tangent to two circles

nearest pair of points 
voronoi diagram construction


DP

Convex hull dp code
Types of DP optimizations
SOS DP short example code (can be skipped if needed)
