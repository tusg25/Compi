1)  **Offline Paging/Caching**: Storage capacity is $k$ (i.e. at a time-frame atmost $k$ variable can be loaded into memory), you have $n$ job requests (each request require a variable to be processed) in sequencing. Required to do $i$-th job in $i$-th timeframe (so required variable should be in memory). Initially storage is empty. Loading $i$-th variable in memory cost $c[i]$ (when storage is full you need to replace it with something). Find best (min-cost) variable loading scheduling.
> Note: Can be modified to have more than one variable per job and preloaded storage.
