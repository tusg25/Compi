Adhoc:
	Shitty Stuff some random query looks n^2
		Write a brute force to find if some range limits n^2 to n*range
		E.g. https://codeforces.com/contest/1168/standings/friends/true (Van der Waerden number)

Graphs:
	General undirected graph ask you to do stuff only once on edges
		Try bi-connected components decompositions
		E.g. https://codeforces.com/contest/652/problem/E

Queries:
	Range query involving |a-b|<=something
		Divide it in two half query till something+b and subtract till something-b
		E.g.	https://codeforces.com/contest/1139/problem/F,
				https://codeforces.com/contest/762/problem/E.
