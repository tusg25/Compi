Adhoc:
	Shitty Stuff some random query looks n^2
		Write a brute force to find if some range limits n^2 to n*range
			E.g. https://codeforces.com/contest/1168/standings/friends/true (Van der Waerden number)
	
	Some values till 60:
		Try bitmask considering 60 bit numbers
			E.g. https://codeforces.com/contest/620/problem/E
			     https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1114/F (~ 60 primes)

	Some values till 100:
		Try iterating for each query for 100 values
			E.g. https://codeforces.com/contest/1185/problem/C2
			
	Values till 1e9 / around 500 different items:
		Try n root max ai
		Divide in sqrt chunks to see if some items less than root ai what happens
			E.g. https://codeforces.com/contest/792/problem/E
		
Graphs:
	General undirected graph ask you to do stuff only once on edges
		Try bi-connected components decompositions
			E.g. https://codeforces.com/contest/652/problem/E

Queries:
	Range query involving |a-b|<=something
		Divide it in two half query till something+b and subtract till something-b
			E.g.  https://codeforces.com/contest/1139/problem/F,
				  https://codeforces.com/contest/762/problem/E.

Exponential:
	Try meet in the middle
		E.g. https://codeforces.com/contest/585/problem/D
	Submask dp
